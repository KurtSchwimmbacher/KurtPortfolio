This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Portfolio Narrative Structure Guide

Guidance for making the portfolio more narrative and story-driven.

### 1. Narrative Structure & Flow

**Current state:** Projects are listed sequentially (like a catalog)

**Narrative approach:**

- Arrange projects in a story arc: Challenge → Journey → Growth → Impact
- Start with a project that sparked your interest, then show progression
- End with your most impactful work to show maturity
- Use transitions between projects that explain how each led to the next

### 2. Add Storytelling Elements to Project Descriptions

**Current state:** Functional descriptions ("Built with...", "Features include...")

**Narrative approach:**

- **The Problem:** Start with the user's pain point or challenge
- **The Journey:** Describe your process, decisions, and obstacles
- **The Insight:** What you learned and why it matters
- **The Outcome:** Impact on users, not just features

**Example transformation:**

- Instead of: "AscendAI helps colorblind climbers identify legal holds..."
- Try: "While climbing with a colorblind friend, I watched them struggle to identify route holds—something I'd never considered. This moment sparked a question: how can technology bridge this gap? AscendAI was born from that question..."

### 3. Create Connecting Threads

**Current state:** Projects feel disconnected

**Narrative approach:**

- Identify themes across your work (accessibility, empowerment, solving overlooked problems)
- Add brief transitions: "This project taught me about accessibility, which led me to..."
- Show how your interests and skills evolved across projects

### 4. Personal Journey Integration

**Current state:** About Me is at the end, separate from work

**Narrative approach:**

- Weave personal context into projects (why you chose this, what it means to you)
- Show evolution: early projects → current work → future direction
- Use the Hero section to hint at your story, not just credentials

### 5. Visual Storytelling

**Current state:** Images are static showcases

**Narrative approach:**

- Choose images that show process, not just final results
- Use images that tell a story: problem → solution → impact
- Consider showing user interactions or moments of discovery

### 6. Add Context and Stakes

**Current state:** Projects are presented without much context

**Narrative approach:**

- Set the scene: when/where/why this project happened
- Explain stakes: what happens if this problem isn't solved?
- Show constraints: what limitations did you work within?

### 7. Use First-Person Storytelling

**Current state:** Third-person descriptions

**Narrative approach:**

- Write in first person ("I discovered...", "I learned...")
- Share moments of uncertainty or breakthrough
- Make it personal: connect to your values and goals

### 8. Temporal Progression

**Current state:** Projects feel timeless

**Narrative approach:**

- Show chronology: "As a second-year student, I..." → "By my third year..."
- Indicate growth: early work was simpler, current work is more complex
- Connect to your education timeline and milestones

### 9. Problem-First Approach

**Current state:** Project-first descriptions

**Narrative approach:**

- Start each project with the problem, not the solution
- Show your thinking process: how you analyzed the problem
- Reveal the solution as the resolution

### 10. Emotional Connection

**Current state:** Technical and functional

**Narrative approach:**

- Share why each project matters to you
- Connect to your values (e.g., inclusivity, empowerment)
- Show the human impact, not just technical achievements

### Quick Wins to Start

1. Rewrite one project description using "Problem → Journey → Insight → Outcome"
2. Add 1-2 sentences between projects explaining how they connect
3. Start the Hero section with a brief story about your journey
4. Use first-person throughout
5. Add "why" context to each project (why this problem, why this solution)

The goal is to make your portfolio read like a journey of growth and discovery, not just a collection of work. Each project should feel like a chapter in your story.
